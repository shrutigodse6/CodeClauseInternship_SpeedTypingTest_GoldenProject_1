Python Golden Project: 1 SPEED TYPING TEST IN PYTHON :--

This Python script defines a simple speed typing test program. The program prompts the user to type a given text as fast and accurately as possible, measures the time taken, calculates the words per minute, and evaluates the accuracy of the user's input.

1.The speed_typing_test function is defined, which takes a text parameter.
2.The function prints the given text and prompts the user to press Enter when ready to start.
3.It records the start time using time.time() just before the user starts typing
4.The user is prompted to type the given text
5.The end time is recorded after the user ha finished typing.
6.The elapsed time is calculated by subtracting the start tie from the end time.
7.Words per minute (WPM) is calculated using the formula: (number of words / elpsed time) * 60.
8.The function then prints the time taken, words per minute, and a message indicating the nextstep.
9.It calculates the number of correctly typed words by comparing each word in the given text with he corresponding word in the user's input.
10.The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correct words to the total number of words in the text.
11.The function prints the accuracy percentage.
12.In the __main__ block, a sample text is provided, and the speed_typing_test function is called with this text.
13.The user is prompted to type the given text, and after typing, the program prints the time taken, words per minute, and accuracy.
